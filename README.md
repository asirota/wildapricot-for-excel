# Microsoft Excel Reporting and Analysis Dashboard for Wild Apricot

# Project Description

# Features

# System Requirements

The dashboard is only supported on Excel for Windows 2007 and later. It is not supported in Office 365.

Unfortuantely due to limitations for XML parsing support on Excel for Mac, the dashboard is not support on Apple Macintosh computers.
